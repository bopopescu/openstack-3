Downloading/unpacking iso8601>=0.1.9 (from python-keystoneclient>=0.8.0->django-openstack-auth)
  
pip can't proceed with requirement 'iso8601>=0.1.9 (from python-keystoneclient>=0.8.0->django-openstack-auth)' due to a pre-existing build directory.
 location: /data/src/iver/horizon/virtualenv/build/iso8601
This is likely due to a previous installation that failed.
pip is being responsible and not assuming it can delete this.
Please delete it and try again.
